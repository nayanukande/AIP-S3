![enter image description here](https://github.com/nayanukande/AIP-S3/blob/main/asserts/banner_image.jpg)
Our project mainly based on NLP and created for Hackatra hackathon conducted on DevPost [Hackatra hackathon](https://hackatra.devpost.com/) .

### Introduction
AIP-S3 is an Cloud deployed app, we are building it for betterment for the Questioning and Answering. we used Hugging Face for the deployment. 

 - **Text Summarizer** - It is a automatic text summarization page which supports different types of text data from different sources.
 - **Semantic Searh** - Semantic search is a data searching technique in which a search query not only finds keywords, but also determines the intent and contextual meaning of the words a person is using for search. With the help of OpenAI it performs the [semantic search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/search) on the given document and provide the best result.

### Tools & Software used

 - [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) Hugging Face is a community and data science platform that provides: Tools that enable users to build, train and deploy ML models based on open source (OS) code and technologies.
 - [Jupyter Notebook] - Project Jupyter is a community run project with a goal to "develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages"
 - [GitHub Desktop] - GitHub Desktop is an application that enables you to interact with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. GitHub Desktop encourages you and your team to collaborate using best practices with Git and GitHub.
 - [docx2txt](https://pypi.org/project/docx2txt/) - A pure python-based utility to extract text and images from docx files.
 - [txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai) - txtai executes machine-learning workflows to transform data and build AI-powered semantic search applications.
